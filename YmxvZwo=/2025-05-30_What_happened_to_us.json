    "I remember when hacking meant opening something not meant to be opened.",
    "When \"why not?\" was enough of a reason to reverse engineer a bootloader.",
    "Now it's all sponsored posts and capture-the-flag marketing fluff.",
    "People call themselves hackers because they used Burp Suite once on a bug bounty.",
    "No one breaks things to understand them anymore — they just wait for tools to be released.",
    "Scripts are swapped, tokens are farmed, creds dumped... but no one *knows* the systems.",
    "Not the BIOS bytes, not the syscall chains, not even the TCP flags.",
    "Everything is sanitized, packaged, and sold back to us by people who’ve never popped a shell.",
    "We’ve got “hacker” conferences with wristbands and brand partners.",
    "I don’t want your Discord server — I want my TTY back.",
    "We used to trace UART pins with paperclips.",
    "Now it’s all USB rubber ducks and badge firmware updates.",
    "Whatever this is now — it isn’t hacking.",
    "And I’m still here. Still digging.",
    "Still breaking things just to see what falls out."
